                    <h2>Meet Web App</h2>
                    <p>
                        A Progressive Web App with offline capabilities for viewing meet-ups pulled from the Google Calendar API. 
                        The App allows users to filter by city and number of events and also displays a chart of meetings by subject and a graph of meetings by city. 
                        Meet App was created with Create React App and has a 100% testing coverage with unit, integration, acceptance, and end-to-end tests.<br>
                        Jest is used as a testing framework with Enzyme, Cucumber, and Puppeteer integrations.<br>
                        Serverless functions hosted on AWS Lambda are used for authenticating the users Google account.<br>
                        <br>
                        In building this app I learned about serverless functions, OAuth, CRA, TDD and BDD, Gherkin, PWAs, OOP class inheritance, and performance monitoring.

                    <h2>Chat App</h2>
                    <p>
                        A native mobile application that was developed using Expo and React-Native. The app uses the gifted-chat library to serve the common chat capabilities.<br>
                        Besides the obvious chatting functionality, the user is able to send images from his device's library, take a photo with the device's built-in camera and share his location.<br>
                        The data gets stored in a firestore database whereas the images themselves are stored as blobs in a dedicated storage. The app therefore is designed as a real-time application.<br>
                        Offline users are able to read the messages, since they get stored in the device's local storage while being online.<br>
                        <br>
                        In building this app I learned about native mobile application development, RTAs, blob-storage and Emulators/Simulators.

                        <br>
                        In building this app I learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript in general as well as jQuery and Bootstrap to simplify and speed up the development process.

                    <h2>myFlix - API</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project's objective was to create a REST API for an application that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies.<br>
                        <br>
                        In this project, I had the chance to build an entire API from the scratch and therefore, started looking at the backend side of web programming. The use of Node.js was essential.
                        The concepts of modules, packages (and their managers, respectively) as well as deploying web services to be accessed via the internet have been targeted throughout the project and therefore, have gotten into deeper understanding.<br>
                        <br>
                        In building this API I learned about authentication / authorization (basic HTTP + jwt), password hashing, CSP and overall about the REST API architecture.<br>
                        Additionally I got to know MongoDB and Express.

                    <h2>myFlix - Client</h2>
                    <p>
                        Within this project I developed the corresponding client app for the myFlix API.
                        The app displays information about movies, that are stored within a database to registered (and logged in) users.<br>
                        Furthermore users are able to save movies to a list of favorite movies as well as to update their credentials and to deregister.<br>
                        <br>
                        This app was build using Angular which has been the third frontend framework I got to work with and furthermore has been the most complex and opinionated one.<br>
                        I learned about Angular, Angular Material, TypeScript, Rxjs, JSDoc, TypeDoc and Scss.
